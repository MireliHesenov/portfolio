  Hi, I'm Mirali! I've been making websites since 2020 and I work as a software
  engineer. I consistently deliver solutions that balance both technical excellence
  and visual quality.

I've decided to share my knowledge on this website, and it also helps me stay up to date.

Here, you can see the [open-source projects](/projects) and [portfolio](/portfolio) I have developed and read the [technical articles](/blog) and notes I have written.
