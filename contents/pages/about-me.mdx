# About me

Hi, I'm Firuzcan! I've been making websites since 2018 and I work as a software engineer. I consistently deliver solutions that balance both technical excellence and visual quality.

I've decided to share my knowledge on this website, and it also helps me stay up to date.

Here, you can see the [open-source projects](/projects) and [portfolio](/portfolio) I have developed and read the [technical articles](/blog) and notes I have written.

<u>My site has no AI generated content and no ads.</u>
